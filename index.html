        6,000 satellites have been launched by over 40 different countries with 1,738 satellites currently in use today.
        Satellites are used by various organizations in military, commercial, government, and civil use.

      <p class="useTitle">SATELLITE USE CASE BY COUNTRY</p>
      <p class="useDesc2">Currently over 40 countries have built and launched satellites. This is a vast increase of the last couple of decades.
        For example, in 1966 only The United States, The USSR, France, The United Kingdom, Canada, and Italy had satellites.
        Now more and more countries are enjoying the benefits of satellites! Currently the United States leads the way with
        803 operating satellites, with Russia and China following behind. As you can see from the graphs each country uses
        their satellites for a wide variety of purposes and do not have the same makeup of types of satellites.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p class="useDesc">
        Military Satellites: Most military satellites are used for the purpose of intelligence gathering, navigation, or military
        communication. Early attempts were made at weaponizing satellites but this work was halted in 1967 due to an international
        treaty banning weapons of mass destruction being deployed in orbit. Modern GPS systems were born out of the use of
        military satellites.
      </p>
      <p class="useDesc">
        Civil Satellites: Civil satellites are satellites categorized as for use in academic or amateur nature. Most of these satellites
        are owned and used by universities all around the world. There are currently 128 civil satellites in orbit currently.
        Another one will be launched on May 11, 2018 courtesy of the University of Nairobi in Kenya.
      </p>
      <p class="useDesc">
        Commercial Satellites: Commercial satellites are satellites used in a variety of ways. They are normally used for satellite
        navigation, satellite television, and satellite imagery with a potential for space tourism in the near future. The
        first ever commercial satellite launched was Telstar-1 in 1962, which was used to transmit television signal over
        the Atlantic Ocean.

    <div class="igIntro">
      <div class="igIntroText">Since 1957 all sorts of satellites have been launched in varieties of different sizes and shapes. Sputnik 1 was the first ever satellite launched by the USSR and was only the size of a beach ball, 2 feet in diameter. Today the satellites are much bigger and complex. For example, the Terrastar-1 that launched in 2009 weighs a whopping 15,233 pounds and has a wingspan of 106 feet! Terrastar-1 is primarily used to provide mobile voice and data communications in North America for cellular phones.</div>

      <div class="igRightText">International Space Station: The ISS is arguably one of the most famous satellites in orbit currently. It is a joint project between the space agencies of the United States, Russia, Japan, the European Union, and Canada. The station has been developed piecemeal by the launching of modules to add on to the existing modules in orbit. The first part of the station was launched in 1998 and the station is anticipated to be in use until 2028. The ISS is the largest human-made object currently in Earth’s orbit, and is bigger than an NFL football field.</div>

Named after astronomer Edwin Hubble the satellite was launched in 1990 into a low Earth orbit. The satellite is about the size of a school bus. While the telescope was built and launched by NASA any group of any nationality can reserve time on the telescope, however most proposals for time are rejected due to high demand of the telescope. The telescope is estimated to last until 2035 and its successor is being launched in May 2020.</div>

Its primary goal was to take up-to-date and cloud free images of the Earth. Many companies have licensed the images from Landsat-7 and used them in commercial applications. For example, most of the images used in Google Earth/Maps are collected by Landsat-7. The satellite is able to photograph about one quarter of the earth’s landmass every 16 days.</div>
